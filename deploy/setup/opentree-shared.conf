# This file is for apache 2.4+. It was derived from the file
# /etc/apache2/sites-available/default in apache2 as installed in ubuntu 12.04.
#
# Now that we're supporting both HTTP and HTTPS, this file contains all the
# shared configuration for VirtualHosts in 'opentree.conf' and 'opentree-ssl.conf'. See
# http://serverfault.com/questions/83669/apache2-with-ssl-do-i-have-to-copy-virtualhost-blocks
#
# This file should be periodically reviewed as apache versions advance and
# 'best practice' for virtual host configurations changes.
