# Open Tree of Life version 14.8

Version 14.8 of the synthetic tree was generated on 25 September 2023 using the [propinquity pipeline](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/propinquity).

## Downloads
There are two downloads. The first (smaller download) contain only tree and annotations files. The second (larger download) is the full output from the synthesis procedure, including documentation. 

* [Tree and annotations](https://files.opentreeoflife.org/synthesis/opentree14.8/opentree14.8tree.tgz) : Several versions of the synthetic tree, along with the annotations file. See the enclosed README for details. (compressed tar archive; 37 Mbytes)
* [All pipeline outputs](https://files.opentreeoflife.org/synthesis/opentree14.8/opentree14.8.tgz) : Outputs and documentation from all stages of the synthesis pipeline. Or, you can [browse the output](https://files.opentreeoflife.org/synthesis/opentree14.7/output/index.html) rather than downloading. (compressed tar archive; 475 Mbytes)
